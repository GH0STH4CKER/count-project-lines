# Line Counter Tool

The Line Counter Tool is a Python script that counts the total number of lines in a directory and its subdirectories. It can be useful to get an overview of the size and complexity of a project.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the script to your local machine.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the Line Counter Tool script.

4. Run the script with the following command, replacing `<project_root>` with the path to your project's root directory:

   ```bash
   python line_counter.py <project_root>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   python line_counter.py F:\bitleonex-backend
   ```

5. The script will traverse the specified directory and its subdirectories, counting the lines in each file and displaying the total lines in the project.
